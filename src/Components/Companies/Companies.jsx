                <br/>
                <p>Human body comprises more than 600 muscles. They are the reason why we sit, stand, walk, run and sleep. Without their full strength, we either feel lethargic or experience pain.
                The daily activities and load on our muscles leads to wear and tear. This needs timely rehabilitation and care to retain their optimal strength and function.
